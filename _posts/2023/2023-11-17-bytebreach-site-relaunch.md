Hi all!

For those who periodically have visited this site, you may notice I've adopted a new look for the blog. The old site had a number of issues (both in performance and aesthetic) I wanted to fix.

* The page/post load times were excessively long for what amounted to a relatively lightweight blog.
* The number of unmanaged third-party plugins felt bloated and presented a security risk.
* The look and feel of the site felt a little too on-the-nose for cybersecurity topics.
* The novelty of DALLE-2 featured imagery felt gauche.

In order to address these and other issues while also being mindful of my own preferences in the blog's management, I've made some significant backend changes to improve performance and modernize the blog's aesthetics. Things should now load faster, look nicer, and be more organized.

If you encounter any issues, let me know!
