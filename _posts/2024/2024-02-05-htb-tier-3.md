## Introduction

Late in 2023, Hack The Box announced a new training path along their Academy platform which accompanied an upcoming new certification they plan on releasing later in 2024. This was the first of their certifications which included **Tier 3** module content; up until now content aligned to their certifications (the CDSA, CBBH, and CPTS) all exclusively engaged **Tier 2** material.

Implicitly, the release of the path was meant to suggest that this training would be more challenging and I was eager to see how. At-a-glance, the path was composed of the following modules:

* Injection Attacks
* Introduction to NoSQL Injection
* Attacking Authentication Mechanisms
* Advanced XSS and CSRF Exploitation
* HTTPs/TLS Attacks
* Abusing HTTP Misconfigurations
* HTTP Attacks
* Blind SQL Injection
* Intro to Whitebox Pentesting
* Modern Web Exploitation Techniques
* Introduction to Deserialization Attacks
* Whitebox Attacks
* Advanced SQL Injections
* Advanced Deserialization Attacks
* Parameter Logic Bugs

## Injection Attacks

## Introduction to NoSQL Injection

## Attacking Authentication Mechanisms

## Advanced XSS and CSRF Exploitation

## HTTPs/TLS Attacks

#### Introduction to HTTPs/TLs

This module starts pretty simple and can be completed quite quickly. You're introduced to the concept of certificates, certificate authorities, and using **OpenSSL** early on. From there, the training segways to describing different versions of the TLS protocol and using **Wireshark** to examine some small PCAP files for details about the handshake. Overall, this portion of the module should feel like a brief catch-up for those who have never been formally taught about these matters, but executing the tasks presented is trivial.

#### Padding Oracle Attacks
