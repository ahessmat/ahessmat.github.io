#### DNS Rebinding

This section talks about how - in principal - an attacker in control of a DNS server can rapidly reconfigure which IPv4 address a given URL resolves to; this allows for some interesting bypasses when a victim application interacts with the malicious URL. For a really interesting/complex attack, it was disappointing to see only 2 exercises allocated to the section. Worse still, one of those excersises was just a rehash of SSRF (which has a whole other Tier 2 module dedicated to it: **Server-side Attacks**). Reading through some of the other subsections provides some insight as to how it would be challenging to support multiple exercises, but it's still a bit of a let-down (especially if DNS rebinding were to later show up in the CWEE exam).

#### Second-Order Attacks

This section describes so-called "second-order attacks", which capitalize on manifesting exploits in latent ways; they are not standalone vulnerabilities, but rather describe ways that other vulnerabilities might manifest (e.g. malicious data input at point A might not be problematic until later at point B). As such, the section as a whole doesn't really introduce anything particularly novel that isn't covered in greater depth/detail in other Tier 2 modules (e.g. **Web Attacks**, **Command Injections**, etc.). Instead, it showcases ways how data input in different ways can come together in creative fashions. Altogether, I found this section disappointing, redundant, and at times felt more in-line with CTF-like conditions (vs. instructing to something more applicable); I think the real takeaway someone might learn from this section is the need to creatively apply/arrive at various vulnerabilities, but I'm dubious that the particular techniques shown are of much use outside of Hack The Box.

#### WebSocket Attacks

I thought this section presented some new and interesting information in talking about WebSocket connections, denoted by the `ws://` and `wss://` protocol schemes. The section is really a showcase of how to operatively work with newer protocols (including HTML5) and less about a new attack, couching the provided exercises in performing things like XSS and SQLi (but through WebSocket connections). I got hung-up on the **Exploiting XSS via WebSockets** exercise for a minute because - in the course of testing different payloads - the backend ended up enqueuing my XSS payloads; consequentially payloads that *would* have worked ended up not working at all (much to my confusion/frustration). The easy fix to this was to simply reset the machine, but I did lose a considerable amount of time troubleshooting this.

It was also interesting to note that - for reasons unknown to me - while SQLmap *did* work in some of the section's/module's exercises, it would not always return back the totality of results; while working through one problem with a partner, we learned that SQLmap failed to list *all* of the column names from a particular table (whereas I - going through the process manually - did find them). This was an interesting learning point in-the-moment, though I'm uncertain how much of it is related to **WebSockets** vs. being an exercise in trust-but-verify methodologies in tool usage/enumeration.
