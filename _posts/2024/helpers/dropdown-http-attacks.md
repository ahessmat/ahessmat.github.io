#### CRLF Injection

I'll admit, I thought that this section was pretty weak from the onset. The **Log Injection** subsection felt very derivative from the Log Poisoning training presented in the Tier 2 **File Inclusion** module and the enumeration strategies presented in the Tier 2 **Command Injection** module. However, the **HTTP Response Splitting** subsection was unexpectedly challenging and - I feel - a good example of how Hack The Box presents material in a fundamental way and then is able to build upon it in creative fashions in its questions/challenges; in the course of completing that particular subsection, I learned more about HTTP Response headers and using XHR than what I would have expected in just what the subsection suggests is needed. The section wraps up with **SMTP Header Injections** - the accompanying exercise can be completed by a close reading of the material, though the solution is not a literal copy/paste of what's presented.
