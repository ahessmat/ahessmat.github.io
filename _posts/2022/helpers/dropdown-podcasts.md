## Podcasts

Sometimes it helps to talk things through in order to learn cybersecurity. For a technically-grounded subject, cybersecurity can be challenging to relay in just the audio medium; however, there are a number of podcasts that really work well in either being informative, fun, or both. Below are several mini-reviews of ones I listen to:

* [**Compiler**](https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast): While this Redhat-hosted podcast is geared towards technology more generally, this is a really well-produced show. I'd like to highlight episode 14 ("How Can Memes Improve Security?"), episode 20 ("When Should Data Die?"), and episodes 23/24 ("Are Big Mistakes That Big Of A Deal?" [Parts 1 & 2]) for folks interested in cybersecurity more specifically.
* [**Cyber by VICE/Motherboard**](https://www.vice.com/en/topic/cyber-podcast): I really wanted to like this podcast for the diversity of subject matters that get brought up, but the unedited conversations between the hosts tend to lead to extended and frequent tangents that I find distracting. However, I really like the "[My First Hack](https://www.vice.com/en/topic/my-first-hack)" mini-series the show performs, where they interview folks 1-on-1 with notable security personalities.
* [**Darknet Diaries**](https://darknetdiaries.com/): This is a really well-produced podcast that touches on all manner of subjects as they relate to hacking, cyber crime, data breaches, and more. I could do without the host's subjectivity interjections, but Jack Rhysider can be credited for making the content more accessible and engaging to a wider audiance.
* [**Hackable? By McAfee**](https://www.mcafee.com/blogs/hackable/): This was a well-produced podcast that explores the various avenues and methods your devices can be compromised (generally at a high-level). They often demonstrate the attacks on the producers of the show, much to their shock and amazement. Unfortunately, McAfee appeas to have suspended production of the show as it hasn't put out a new episode since 2019.
* [**Hacked by Sticks & Stones**](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/hacked-sticks-stones-AJQ4DOeq1p2/): This show has pivoted to doing long-form journalism on a variety of cybersecurity-related subjects. The matter is presentable and easy to follow with great audio quality and production. This is one of my personal favorites.
* [**Malicious Life by Cyberreason**](https://malicious.life/): This show offers a mix of topical subjects, conference presentations, 1-on-1 interviews, and other cyber-related matters. It's fairly well-produced, although the host's commitment to using [non-regional diction](https://youtu.be/d8IEhcN9aFo) can get a little grinding.
* [**The Cyber Work Podcast**](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/podcast/): While covering a wider range of subjects, I generally highlight this podcast for its [Career Series](https://www.infosecinstitute.com/podcast/?Type=Career+Series), which helps address the more broader question "What does [job] do?" 
* [**Hard Fork by NYT**](https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork): Like "Compiler", this podcast is not dedicated to cybersecurity but emergent technology at large and its relationship to us as people. I think that this one is compelling in the way that it occupies similar spaces of concern as cybersecurity more generally in being interested in more than just tech specs but its implications/ramifications.
