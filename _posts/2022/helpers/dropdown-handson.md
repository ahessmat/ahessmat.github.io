## Hands-On Resources

Sometimes the best way to learn cybersecurity is by just working with the tools and technologies themselves. Whether you want to code, hack, or just learn the basics, these platforms and services are built to drop you in the thick of it and get your hands dirty.

So what do you want to learn?

### The Command Line

For a lot of people, most interactions with computers and applications is through some kind of Graphical User Interface (GUI), this includes things like a smartphone's touchscreen, Windows Desktop, web browsers, etc. However if you're going to become involved with cybersecurity professionally, you'll need to get comfortable using a command line interface (CLI) terminal.

* [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/): specifically, the "Bandit" series offered by OverTheWire is an excellent way to gamify your learning in getting introduced to the Linux CLI with a security flair. Like many of the resources listed here, it's completely free.
* [LearnEnough](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial): Michael Hartl's tutorial to the Unix command line is a guided introduction to using CLI, complete with exercises, all for free.
* [LinuxJourney](https://linuxjourney.com/): This offers a simpler walkthrough of CLI and quite a bit more. It's lean, pretty to look at, and all completely free.
* [PowerShellTutorial](https://powershelltutorial.net/): most people getting started learning CLI tend to prioritize learning Unix OS CLI, but you'll probably want to also gear up on Powershell for Windows environments; PowerShellTutorial.net is a great resource to that end.
* [Cisco Learning Academy: Linux Essentials](https://www.netdevgroup.com/online/courses/open-source/linux-essentials): for several years now, Cisco's Learning Academy has made this course available for free. It's a phenomenal guided learning course for getting into the thick of how to use Linux CLI.

### Coding

While the vast majority of roles in cybersecurity don't explicitly require you to know how to *write* good code, your professional aptitude would almost assuredly benefit from being able to *read* it. Fortunately, there's a lot of resources online dedicated towards improving your programming-language comprehension.

* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/): This is one of the most popular freely-used resources available for learning the syntax of programming languages. It has structured courses to provide step-by-step instruction on understanding common object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as methods, classes, and data structures.
* [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/): This is an open-source curriculum for learning full-stack web development. It assumes no knowledge of you as a student in walking you through the process to developing your own web application.
* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/): This is less of a resource about how to learn to code and more of how to learn to perform coding *interviews*; this site presents an array of toy problems for you to implement solutions to in your choice of programming language(s). If you're planning on applying to work at Big Tech, this is a resource you cannot ignore.
* **The Python Challenge**: This is a gamified series of puzzles that were built to encourage learning Python through practical application.
* [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/): This is my favorite resource to recommend folks getting innoculated to SQL syntax. It's a gamified murder mystery, and the only way to solve the mystery is through the use of SQL queries. The initial steps are quite basic, but getting to the end requires understanding and stringing together increasingly complex SQL statements.
* [Sad Server](https://sadservers.com/scenarios): This was a neat find recently; it helps promote code literacy by setting up some small debugging problems (and a handful of classic CTF challenges) for you to puzzle through.

### General Cybersecurity Training

Beyond learning just the above fundamentals, there are a number of services and platforms that cater to cybersecurity skills more narrowly.

* [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/): This is a site that aggregates online Capture-the-Flag (CTF) stylized cybersecurity competitions. If you are unfamiliar with CTF events, they serve as small-scale competitions that often develop/challenge technical skills. Most are free and some offer rewards; the most noteworthy of them all is the annual [DEFCON team-vs-team event held in Las Vegas](https://defcon.org/html/links/dc-ctf.html). For those just getting started you might consider the more approachable [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) which is geared towards high-school and college students.
* [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/): This is a platform that sets up various online "rooms" that focus on teaching/introducing different exploits or vulnerabilities. Great for walking novices through difficult concepts.
* [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/): A platform that stands up a rotating series of intentionally vulnerable targets for anyone to compromise. They also offer more diverse environments with their ProLabs and Battlegrounds offerings for a fee.
* [Hack The Box's Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/): This is a parallel service offering to Hack The Box's main platform. It offers catered guided learning to a great number of topics, but requires money to fully access. I resoundingly endorse this training platform, especially for individuals who qualify for the student subscription discount.
* [LetsDefend](https://letsdefend.io/): A similar platform to Hack The Box, but with a defensive flair. Instead of compromising vulnerable machines, you are required to investigate tickets denoting attacks on a network you need to defend.
* [Pentester Academy](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/topics): This platform offers a slew of offensively-oriented trainings. Requires a recurring subscription to access its content; they recently transferred the administration of this function to INE, which is a massive improvement.
* [Portswigger's Web Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security): This is the spiritual successor to Pinto's "The Web Application Hacker's Handbook". This is the most in-depth, freely available, web app vulnerability training out there. The content is geared specifically towards using Burp Suite, but other tools are viable.
