## The Start of Things

Cybersecurity as a professional career can be incredibly rewarding:

* You get to work and understand the latest technologies and threats to those technologies.
* Your work protects others (sometimes millions of others) from bad actors.
* [The average cybersecurity employee makes nearly 3x the national median in the US in salary](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm#tab-5).
* ...and much, much more.

If you are interested in career in this space, then this blog post is for you.

## Orientation

Before diving headlong into considerations like degree-granting programs, certifications, etc., you should take some time to survey the domain and understand how you might eventually fit into it. We want to answer questions like:

* What kinds of jobs exist within cybersecurity and - of those - which do I find appealing?
* Of the jobs I'd like to eventually attain, what actions do I need to take in order to be employable?
* What are the risks/costs I need to be mindful of?

The overall goal is to learn more about the industry in order to help inform your decision about whether or not to move forward; it's better to determine sooner rather than later if cybersecurity is for you because careers in this space typically do not manifest quickly, easily, or cheaply.

> If you're feeling adventurous, you could also consider checking out some of the freely-available, gamified learning competitions out there known as Capture-the-Flag (CTF) events. Just be aware that these kinds of competitions can be pretty challenging, especially for those only just getting acquainted to tech more generally.

### What kind of jobs exist in cybersecurity?

A common misconception for many is in thinking that all jobs in cybersecurity are the same. Moreover, some people think that cybersecurity jobs are strictly all about hacking. But these notions couldn't be farther from the truth: Cybersecurity is not a monolith.

One common mistake people make in looking to pivot into cybersecurity is failing to cater their resume towards a specific line of work. Generalizing your education at the onset is good in order to get a foundational understanding of cybersecurity concepts, but when you're looking at becoming employable you should focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools, verbiage, and methodologies applicable to *specific* roles.

#### Red vs. Blue

Classically, cybersecurity work is generalized as being either "red" or "blue" in affiliation, alluding to the work being done as being more offensively-oriented (i.e. hacking something) or defensively-geared (i.e. detecting/preventing something getting hacked). Jobs that lean more "red" might include (but are not limited to):

* Red teamers
* Penetration testers
* AppSec Engineers
* Exploit developers
* Bug bounty hunters

While jobs that lean more "blue" might include (but are not limited to):

* Malware analysts
* SOC analysts
* Security engineers
* GRC functionaries
* Incident responders

This crude paradigm helps categorize work more generally, but lacks nuance and fails to account for a more broader spectrum of available work. AppSec engineering and GRC functions don't neatly fit the moulds as being red/blue, respectively, for example. Mike Sass from [ShellSharks](https://shellsharks.com/) published this nice chart which shows what we're talking about:

#### Career Trajectories

Not all jobs in cybersecurity are immediately accessible from the start - in fact, most are not. While *some* people are fortunate enough to attain employment directly into the kind of cybersecurity work they want to do, many have to make intermediate hops between positions leading up to (and through) their "dream job". Below are links to several examples which show how such career trajectories might look like.

The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) developed [a great tool](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/cyber-career-pathways-tool) reflecting the kinds of career moves that inter-relate to one another this way, including "On Ramps" from cyber-adjacent lines of work like Systems Administration and Data Analysis.

[Cyberseek](https://www.cyberseek.org/pathway.html) - a tool developed in partnership between CompTIA and Lightcast - offers a more generalized view that also shows moves that can be made while also supplying amplifying context, such as average salary, requested level of education, etc.

Paul Jerimy - more often recognized for his work in [aggregating certifications](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/) - put together his take in 2022 within the chart below:

## Initial Actions

Having done the above, now it's time we look to get serious. While the cybersecurity workforce is relatively diverse insofar individual experiences and histories go, generally speaking the most common ways into your first cybersecurity job are:

* University + Internships
* Years of cyber-adjacent employment
* Military Service
* Internal lateral moves

### University & Internships

This is a popular option and one that's often paired with any of the others mentioned. For many people coming up in the space, academia is a familiar framework: you go to classes, perform tests/projects, and semester-over-semester (or quarter-over-quarter) build up on a body of knowledge about your major area of study. For people who appreciate a more structured approach, pursuing your degree is generally what you want to do. There's a lot of other benefits to attaining a degree as well, especially for younger people:

* Degree-granting programs often feature inter-disciplinary coursework, providing you with a more holistic education in areas like Artificial Intelligence, Law, Business, Politics, Mathematics, etc. Topically, these kinds of classes cover subject matter you might only incidentally encounter otherwise.
* Having a degree of any kind whatsoever is becoming an increasingly common job application filter; applicants lacking at least a bachelors degree from an accredited university are often at a significant disadvantage in attaining interviews compared to graduates. It also mitigates risk considerably in the event of a job loss (e.g. layoffs, illness/injury, etc.).
* Degrees - unlike many certifications - never expire.

One important facet of a university education that should be highlighted is the opportunity to pursue internships. While some of the other options can take *years* before getting a chance to work in cybersecurity roles, internships are one of the few exceptions to this; generally restricted only to enrolled students, internships are a form of seasonal employment directly into supervised cybersecurity work. In the best case scenario, performing well at an internship can even offer a path to becoming a full-time employee after graduation.

**It cannot be understated enough how important it is that you cultivate your work history**.

Understandably, not everyone will be able to land their dream internship; for those unable to do so (or if you are between internships), you should consider looking at part-time employment in a cyber-adjacent position or workstudy through your university's IT department. While not ideal, these opportunities are *far* better than having a totally unrelated work history (or worse, no work history at all).

### Cyber-adjacent employment

Another path that people have found success in is working first in cyber-adjacent lines of work, then specializing or otherwise pivoting into dedicated cybersecurity roles later. Examples of cyber-adjacent work includes (but isn't limited to): systems administration, network engineering, web development, software engineering, etc. Employers *strongly* prioritize a relevant work history among applicants, so cultivating work experiences in fields like Information Technology significantly improve your chances.

Once you've acquired several years of experience this way, most will look to supplement their employability with things like certifications or degrees. You might also consider looking into things like CTF participation, homelabbing, and projects.

#### The Helpdesk

If you're just starting out, chances are you still might struggle to land one of the aforementioned roles; most software engineering positions require a computer science degree and are themselves quite competitive, for example. This begs the question of how you can start getting experience if you don't have experience.

More often than not, cybersecurity mentors frequently point to one particular role that you might consider: the helpdesk. In most organizations, the helpdesk technician is an IT role responsible for things like troubleshooting computer issues, installing/updating software, triaging trouble tickets, providing end-user support, maintaining operating systems, and more. Both the technical hard skills and the client-facing soft skills translate very well to an eventual career in cybersecurity.

There's plenty of other reasons why you might consider applying to the helpdesk as well:

* Most organizations have an IT department and - therefore - a helpdesk. This makes the role ubiquitous.
* Being the bottom rung on the IT hierarchy makes it a cyber-adjacent line of work with the lowest barrier of entry.
* As many seek to move up/out of the helpdesk, the position tends to experience the most churn. This makes the role more available to apply for.

Having said all that, it's important to note that it's not mandatory for anyone interested in working in cybersecurity to start at the helpdesk. It's just a common denominator for a lot of people at square zero.

### Military Service

Military service is another viable option for making your way into cybersecurity as a career. They can take people who are otherwise unskilled and train them up to perform the job in a matter of weeks/months. [The U.S. Air Force purports to be able to do this in as short as 7.5 weeks](https://www.airforce.com/careers/intelligence/cyber-system-operations), for example.

This approach not only provides you training and an applicable work history *directly* into cybersecurity, but also equips you with a government clearance (which can aid in attaining work with other agencies - such as the NSA - or federal contractors). Veterancy also benefits from the GI Bill, which covers the cost of tuition for almost every U.S. university.
