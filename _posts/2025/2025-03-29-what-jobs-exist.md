## Orientation

Before diving headlong into considerations like degree-granting programs, certifications, etc., you should take some time to survey the domain of cybersecurity and understand how you might eventually fit into it. We want to answer questions like:

* What kinds of jobs exist within cybersecurity and - of those - which do I find appealing?
* Of the jobs I'd like to eventually attain, what actions do I need to take in order to be employable?
* What are the risks/costs I need to be mindful of?

The overall goal is to learn more about the industry in order to help inform your decision about whether or not to move forward; it's better to determine sooner rather than later if cybersecurity is for you because careers in this space typically do not manifest quickly, easily, or cheaply.

> If you're feeling adventurous, you could also consider checking out some of the freely-available, gamified learning competitions out there known as Capture-the-Flag (CTF) events. Just be aware that these kinds of competitions can be pretty challenging, especially for those only just getting acquainted to tech more generally.

### What kind of jobs exist in cybersecurity?

A common misconception for many is in thinking that all jobs in cybersecurity are the same. Moreover, some people think that cybersecurity jobs are strictly all about hacking. But these notions couldn't be farther from the truth: Cybersecurity is not a monolith.

One mistake people make in looking to pivot into cybersecurity is failing to cater their resume towards a specific line of work. Generalizing your education at the onset is good in order to get a foundational understanding of cybersecurity concepts, but when you're looking at becoming employable you should focus on familiarizing yourself with the tools, verbiage, and methodologies applicable to *specific* roles. University students in particular tend to make this error, sometimes not giving any thought towards what job they might work until they've already graduated.

#### Red vs. Blue

Classically, cybersecurity work is generalized as being either "red" or "blue" in affiliation, alluding to the work being done as being more offensively-oriented (i.e. hacking something) or defensively-geared (i.e. detecting/preventing something getting hacked). Jobs that lean more "red" might include (but are not limited to):

* Red teamers
* Penetration testers
* AppSec Engineers
* Exploit developers
* Bug bounty hunters

While jobs that lean more "blue" might include (but are not limited to):

* Malware analysts
* SOC analysts
* Security engineers
* GRC functionaries
* Incident responders

This crude paradigm helps categorize work more generally, but lacks nuance and fails to account for a more broader spectrum of available work. AppSec engineering and GRC functions don't neatly fit the moulds as being red/blue, respectively, for example. Mike Sass from [ShellSharks](https://shellsharks.com/) published this nice chart which shows what we're talking about:

#### Career Trajectories

Not all jobs in cybersecurity are immediately accessible from the start - in fact, most are not. While *some* people are fortunate enough to attain employment directly into the kind of cybersecurity work they want to do, many have to make intermediate hops between positions leading up to (and through) their "dream job". Below are links to several examples which show how such career trajectories might look like.

The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies (NICCS) developed [a great tool](https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/cyber-career-pathways-tool) reflecting the kinds of career moves that inter-relate to one another this way, including "On Ramps" from cyber-adjacent lines of work like Systems Administration and Data Analysis.

[Cyberseek](https://www.cyberseek.org/pathway.html) - a tool developed in partnership between CompTIA and Lightcast - offers a more generalized view that also shows moves that can be made while also supplying amplifying context, such as average salary, requested level of education, etc.

Paul Jerimy - more often recognized for his work in [aggregating certifications](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/) - put together his take in 2022 within the chart below:
