# Why should I consider a job in cybersecurity?

Whether you're a young student just getting started with your studies or a career-changer looking to reshape your professional life, cybersecurity careers have a lot of reasons to be attractive:

* In the U.S., the average compensation for careers in cybersecurity are nearly 3x the national median for all occupations.[^footnote]
* The cybersecurity workforce continues to experience significant shortages in qualified personnel, with a reported gap of 4.8 million globally.[^footnote1]
* Careers in cybersecurity include those in the offensive and research spaces, affording you the opportunity to hack and discover exploits in hardware and software.[^footnote2]

# What is it like?

A common misconception for many getting started is in thinking that all jobs in cybersecurity are the same. But that couldn't be farther from the truth. Cybersecurity is not a monolith.

You have personnel who concern themselves with `networks`: how machines and users engage one-another and how they can communicate safely and securely.

You have staff concerned with `hardware`: how humans and machines interface, where systems critical to the health and well-being of dozens or even millions of people are at stake.

You have people concerned with `data`: how information in all its forms is meaningful, where preserving its integrity and assuring its availability is paramount.

You have folks who think in a "big picture" sort of way: how organizations and enterprises can be protected at-scale, prescribing policies for everyone to follow and checking to ensure that they are enforced.

You even have folks who engage in more abstract concepts, like the mathematic proofs that undergird cryptography for example.
