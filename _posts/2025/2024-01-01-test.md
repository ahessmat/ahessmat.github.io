## Binary Exploitation

### HTB - Racecar

This was a great way to get back into the swing of things. Rated "Very Easy" by Hack The Box, this `pwn` binary required a few hours of work on my part to solve.

This challenge is shipped without any source code, so we're meant to both reverse engineer the binary and develop an exploit for it. Our first job then is to understand how it works. If we run the `racecar` binary from the command line, we can see that we're prompted with a series of menus to select a car to race with and earn some coins.

The prompts include:

* A Name
* A Nickname
* Car Info vs. Selection menus
* Car Selection
* Racetrack selection

Using `ghidra`, we're able to map out the codeflow through the decompiled code:

```c
void main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  int iVar2;
  int in_GS_OFFSET;
  
  iVar1 = *(int *)(in_GS_OFFSET + 0x14);
  setup();
  banner();
  info();
  while (check != 0) {
    iVar2 = menu();
    if (iVar2 == 1) {
      car_info();
    }
    else if (iVar2 == 2) {
      check = 0;
      car_menu();
    }
    else {
      printf("\n%s[-] Invalid choice!%s\n",&DAT_00011548,&DAT_00011538);
    }
  }
  if (iVar1 != *(int *)(in_GS_OFFSET + 0x14)) {
    __stack_chk_fail_local();
  }
  return;
}

```
