Byte Breach is the personal blog of Asa Hess-Matsumoto, a cybersecurity professional with a passion for research in hacking and software engineering applications.

Having originally graduated from university with a degree in Politics and served overseas as a U.S. Marine Corps officer, Asaâ€™s transitioned entry into the domains of information technology and computer science is non-traditional. As such, he is a strong advocate for continued professional education and development, seeking new and innovative ways to both learn and share what he has learned.

Throughout his career, he has:

* Identified vulnerabilities and assessed risk in large-scale U.S. Department of Defense systems as well as Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) laboratories.
* Secured Industrial Control Systems against cyber attacks on behalf of the Department of the Navy.
* Facilitated red team tabletop exercises to promote dynamic testing of Incident Response policies.
* Reported exploitable vulnerabilities discovered in commercial products, proprietary solutions, and web applications.

He also has fostered an interest in many tangentially-related subjects, including Artificial Intelligence, Reverse Engineering, and Space Platforms.

Asa holds a B.A. in Politics from the University of California, Santa Cruz and is currently enrolled with the Georgia Institute of Technology pursuing a Masters in Computer Science.
